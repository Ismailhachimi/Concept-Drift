# Concept-Drift 

In this repository, we try to implement this [research paper](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/harel14.pdf)'s algorithms for Concept Drift Detection Through Resampling for online detection on a data stream. The data that we use is MNIST (Complete dataset of 70.000 samples).

**PS**: This work isn't complete yet, all contributions are welcome !
